description: >-
  <strong>Rideau Valley Conservation Authority</strong> (RVCA) is one of Ontario's 36
  Conservation Authorities. We are a community based environmental protection
  agency that works closely with municipal, provincial and federal government
  partners, landowners and community groups to conserve, restore, develop and
  manage natural resources in the watershed. The RVCA promotes an integrated
  watershed approach - one that balances human, environmental and economic
  needs. For over 50 years we have actively engaged in environmental monitoring
  and reporting, on-the-ground restoration and stewardship, conservation lands
  and education, development review and approval and flood forecasting and
  warning. Our vision is for a thriving watershed with clean abundant water,
  natural shorelines, rich forests and wetlands, diverse habitat and sustainable
  land use that is valued and protected by all. Our mission is to understand,
  manage, protect, restore and enhance the Rideau watershed through science,
  stewardship, education, policy and leadership.<br>
