  Last Update (mm-dd-yyyy): <strong>8-10-2020<br><br>Fish Communities</strong> is represented as a sampling point with associated metrics/species as an excel spreadsheet. RVCA is part of the Ontario Benthos Biomonitoring Network (OBBN) and RVCA staff follow a provincial protocol for sampling in streams, lakes, and wetlands. A total of three replicates of samples are collected at each of the site locations and are brought back to the RVCA lab for identification. Once identified the samples are run through various indices for Watershed Reporting. Please visit <a
