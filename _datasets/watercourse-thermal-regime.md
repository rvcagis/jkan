title: Watercourse Thermal Regime
organization: RVCA
notes: >-
  Many factors can influence fluctuations in stream temperature, including
  springs, tributaries, precipitation runoff, discharge pipes and stream shading
  from riparian vegetation. Water temperature is used along with the maximum air
  temperature (using the Stoneman and Jones method) to classify a watercourse as
  either warm water, cool water or cold water.
