  represents the physical land type on the earth's surface (ie woodland,
  wetland, water, agriculture, builtup-area etc). It is compiled annually on a
  subwatershed basis. Each subwatershed is captured every six years and is based
  on ortho-rectified imagery, also captured on a 6 year cycle (ie 2008, 2014,
  2020...). RVCA uses this dataset extensively for Subwatershed & Catchment
  Reporting.
