title: Flood Risk/Hazard Mapping Reports
organization: RVCA
notes: 'In cooperation with local municipalities and the province, the RVCA identifies, studies and maps natural hazard areas along local rivers, lakes, streams and wetlands. Natural hazard areas include floodplains, unstable slopes and wetlands. Hazard mapping is used by municipalities for Zoning, development review under the Planning Act, and by RVCA for regulations made under the <a href="https://www.rvca.ca/regulations-planning/rvca-permits-section-28/section-28">Conservation Authorities Act (Section 28)</a>.'
