title: Flood Risk/Hazard Mapping Reports
organization: RVCA
notes: '<strong>RVCA Hazard Reports Webpage</strong><br><br>In cooperation with local municipalities and the province, the RVCA identifies, studies and maps natural hazard areas along local rivers, lakes, streams and wetlands. Natural hazard areas include floodplains, unstable slopes and wetlands. In the past, these maps were called flood risk maps.<br>Hazard mapping is used by municipalities when updating Official Plan and Zoning Schedules and in the review of development applications under the Planning Act. The RVCA uses the mapping for the administration and enforcement of regulations made under the Conservation Authorities Act (Section 28).'
