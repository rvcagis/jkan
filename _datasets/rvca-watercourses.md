  represent the Rivers, Streams, Creeks, Drains etc within the RVCA, as a
  centerline feature class. They have been delineated using the MNRF LIO
  watercourse standard and using the existing LIO Watercourse layer as a base.
  This dataset is used extensively for Subwatershed & Catchment Reporting, as
  well as Regulations. Rivers large enough to meet the waterbody standard are
  also captured as polygons (<i>See RVCA Waterbodies</i>).
